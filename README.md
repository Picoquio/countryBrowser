# Country Browser

 With this application you can look up for countries and some info about them.
 
 The sidebar in the left lets you choose between three different types of search:

 1) *Buscar pais* lets you search for countries given their names. It renders a table with a given amount of countries that match the user's input.
 2) *Por regi√≥n* lets displays a list of buttons, where each represents a continent. Once any given continent is clicked, the application renders a table with a list of all the countries that belong to such continent.
 3) *Por capital* lets you search for countries given their capital city. It renders a table with a given amount of countries that match the user's input.

 

 It also comes with search suggestions in items 1) and 3).

 All data is provided by REST Countries's API.
